description: Use to diagnose and safely operate a live Agentask board — figure out why a task is
  wedged and, only on the human's explicit instruction, remediate it via the agentask CLI
  (transition, promote, archive). Read to diagnose freely; mutate only when told, verify the
  precondition before any irreversible action, never touch tokens. Triggers on "why is <task>
  stuck?", "unstick <task>", "sweep for zombie merge tasks", "this lease expired but didn't release",
  "anything wedged in review?", "promote <task>", "move <task> to <state>". For just *viewing* the
  board, use agentask-board.

# Agentask ops (diagnose · operate)

The wrench for a live Agentask board: diagnose a wedged task and fix it. `agentask-board` is the
dashboard (read-only); this skill is what you reach for when something on it is broken. It reads to
diagnose, then — on the human's word — changes board state through tested CLI verbs.

## The one rule that overrides everything

**Read freely; the human gates every mutation.** Listing, inspecting, and diagnosing are always
fine. Anything that changes board state — `transition`, `promote`, `archive`, create — happens
**only on an explicit human instruction**, and only after you've stated what you're about to do and
why. Before any *irreversible or shared-state* action, **verify the precondition yourself and say
what you found**, then wait for the go-ahead. When unsure whether the human has actually decided,
ask — don't guess and don't act.

## Phase 0 — Configuration

- `AGENTASK_URL` + `AGENTASK_TOKEN` in the environment; the CLI reads them. If missing, ask.
- **Never print, echo, or log a token value** — not the bearer token, not a forge token. Reference
  secrets by env var; never `cat`/`cut` a secrets file into output.
- To *see* the board while diagnosing, use **`agentask-board`** (or its reads: `agentask projects`,
  `agentask tasks --project <id>`, `agentask show <id>`). How to read state for diagnosis:
  `in_progress` + a past `lease_expires_at` = a stuck-task candidate; `review` + a climbing
  `review_round` = a possible reject loop; a non-`done` `kind=merge` task = check it didn't zombie.

## Diagnose & remediate — playbooks

Each entry is **symptom → check → action → guardrail**. Never skip the check; never act past the
guardrail.

### Zombie merge task (merged PR, task stuck `in_progress`)

- **Symptom:** a `kind=merge` task sits `in_progress`; its parent/target task is already `done`.
- **Check:** confirm the PR is actually merged — find the parent's `pr` link, then
  `gh pr view <pr-url> --json state,merged` must show it **MERGED**; confirm the parent is `done`.
- **Action:** `agentask transition <merge-task-id> --to done --note "PR already merged; finalizing zombie merge task"`.
- **Guardrail:** only after the PR is confirmed merged. Never force a merge task to `done` on
  assumption — if the PR isn't merged, the merge genuinely didn't happen.

### Sweep for stuck merge tasks (board-wide)

- **Symptom:** "are any merges wedged?" / a recurrence check after a fleet incident.
- **Check:** list every non-`done` `kind=merge` task across the relevant projects. For each, run the
  zombie check above against its PR before touching it.
- **Action:** finalize only the confirmed-merged zombies; **report — don't touch — the rest**.
- **Guardrail:** **log what you skipped and why.** Never silently "fix all" — a non-merged merge task
  may be legitimately in progress.

### Expired lease not reclaimed

- **Symptom:** a task is `in_progress` with `lease_expires_at` in the past and no recent `updated_at`
  — stranded, no agent finishing it.
- **Check:** confirm the lease is genuinely expired and that no agent is actively working it (state
  hasn't advanced, no fresh heartbeat).
- **Action:** `agentask transition <id> --to ready` so it becomes claimable again.
- **Guardrail:** don't yank a task whose lease is still live — you'd race a working agent and double
  up the work.

### Reject loop (task bouncing review → ready)

- **Symptom:** `review_round` keeps climbing with no convergence; the same task re-enters review
  repeatedly.
- **Check:** read the latest reviewer notes against the task spec. Is the spec demanding more than
  the reviewer will ever pass? Is there a spec ↔ reviewer mismatch, or a genuinely failing build?
- **Action:** surface the mismatch to the human. The real fix is a **spec edit** or a **model-tier
  decision** — both the human's call. Do not silently keep re-dispatching.
- **Guardrail:** never "resolve" a reject loop by approving around the reviewer or forcing the task
  past review. The reviewer's verdict is not yours to override.

### Task wedged in an unexpected state

- **Symptom:** a task sits somewhere it shouldn't (e.g. `in_progress` long after its work merged, or
  `approved` that should have shipped).
- **Check:** `agentask show <id>` — read its links, deps, and history; reconcile against reality
  (the PR, the repo) before concluding it's stuck.
- **Action:** propose the specific transition that reflects reality; execute only on instruction.
- **Guardrail:** verify against the *real* artifact (PR/repo), not the board's stale view, before
  moving anything.

## Hard guardrails (the do-not list)

- **Never archive a project or task you didn't create or can't confirm is dead.** Archive reads as
  destructive even though it's soft server-side; **show what it is and confirm first**. (Note:
  archive is *soft* — an archived project is still claimable by id, so archiving does **not** stop a
  fleet from draining it. If the goal is "stop work," that's a different action.)
- **The human is the merge gate.** Never merge or drive a task to `done` except the
  confirmed-zombie-merge finalize above.
- **Verify before you mutate.** Re-`show` the task immediately before any transition and act on its
  *current* state — board reads go stale fast under a live fleet.
- **One thing at a time, stated out loud.** Announce each mutation and its reason before running it;
  no batch "cleanups" that the human didn't see item by item.
- **Never print tokens.**
