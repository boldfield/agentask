# Feature: Agentask TUI

Status: feature spec, 2026-06-05
Kind: feature_spec (for project Agentask)

## What this is

A minimal terminal UI for Agentask — a keyboard-driven board you live next to in the
terminal. It fixes the one ergonomic hole in the system: today the human side of the loop
is `curl | jq`. The TUI lets a human **see the board** (what's in backlog, being worked,
waiting for review) and **act on it** (promote backlog → ready; approve/reject reviews)
without leaving the terminal.

It is **just another client of the existing HTTP API** — the same API the Haiku agents
drive. It holds no state of its own and talks to no database directly. This re-validates
the API-only design: humans and agents drive the same single source of truth.

## Goals (v1)

- **Pick a project** (`GET /projects`); auto-select if there's one or a configured default.
- **See the board** as five states — `backlog`, `ready`, `in_progress`, `review`, `done` —
  from a single `GET /projects/{id}/tasks` call, bucketed by state client-side.
- **Watch agents work**: `in_progress` cards show `assignee` and a live lease countdown.
- **Promote** a `backlog` task to `ready` (`p`).
- **Work the human gate** from the `review` column: approve (`a`) and reject (`x`). The API
  already supports this end to end (`POST /tasks/{id}/review`, `POST /tasks/{id}/transition`,
  both shipped) — no backend work, which is why it's v1.
- **Task detail** (`enter`): spec, deps, links, result, timestamps.
- **Refresh**: poll on a short interval + a manual refresh key, without disturbing your
  selection.

## Non-goals (v1)

- No web UI. Terminal-only, keyboard-driven.
- No live push/streaming — poll for v1 (an SSE endpoint can come later).
- No task creation/editing in the TUI.
- No event timeline (needs a `GET /tasks/{id}/events` endpoint that does not exist yet).
- No multi-project aggregate view — one project at a time.

## Stack & architecture

- **Go + Bubble Tea** (Charm): `bubbletea` for the loop, `lipgloss` for styling, `bubbles`
  for list/viewport/textinput widgets. New binary `cmd/agentask-tui` (builds to
  `bin/agentask-tui`); add a `tui` Makefile target.
- An **API client** behind an interface (`internal/tuiclient`), wrapping the HTTP API,
  configured from the resolved config (below). It defines its own small response structs
  (external client; does **not** import `internal/store`). Methods: `ListProjects`,
  `ListTasks(projectID)`, `GetTask(id)`, `ListDocuments(projectID)`, `PromoteTask(id)`,
  `ReviewTask(id, actor, verdict, note)`, `TransitionTask(id, to, note)`. The interface is
  the seam for testing (a mock client backs the model tests).
- Bubble Tea is the only state holder; all data is fetched, never cached to disk.

## Configuration

Resolution order (highest wins): **flags > environment > config file > defaults**.

- Config file (TOML) at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agentask/config.toml` (default
  `~/.config/agentask/config.toml`). Keys: `url`, `token`, `actor`, `default_project`,
  `poll_interval` (default `2s`).
- Env: `AGENTASK_URL`, `AGENTASK_TOKEN`, `AGENTASK_ACTOR` (same vars the agents use).
- `actor` (the reviewer identity recorded on review events) defaults to the OS `$USER` when
  unset.
- **Token handling:** prefer `AGENTASK_TOKEN` (env). The file *may* hold `token`, but the
  TUI warns once if a token is read from a world-readable file. No token is ever written to
  disk by the TUI.
- A missing/invalid `url`/`token` produces a clear startup error, not a panic.

## Layout & navigation

**Focused column + tabs.** Column names with counts run across the top as tabs; the active
column's tasks are listed full-width below, so titles are readable. The board never tries to
cram five columns side by side.

```
 backlog(2)  ready(0)  ‹in_progress(1)›  review(0)  done(3)
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 ▸ TUI-2  Board view + nav + polling
     haiku-1 · lease 2m11s · updated 14s ago

   TUI-5  Task detail pane
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 ←/→ column   ↑/↓ select   enter detail   p/a/x act   ? help   q quit
```

- `←/→` (and `h/l`) switch the active column; `↑/↓` (and `j/k`) move the selection within it.
- The selected column's available actions show in the help bar (e.g. `p` only on `backlog`,
  `a/x` only on `review`).
- A column with more tasks than fit scrolls internally (the `bubbles` list handles this).
- Responsive to terminal resize; a minimum width below which it shows a "wider terminal"
  hint rather than rendering garbage.

## Data & refresh

- One `ListTasks(projectID)` call per refresh; bucket by `state` client-side.
- Poll every `poll_interval` (default 2s); `r` forces an immediate refresh.
- **Selection is keyed by task ID and preserved across refreshes** — a poll must never move
  your cursor or reset scroll. If the selected task disappears (state changed/closed), select
  the nearest remaining task in the same column.
- After an action, refetch (no optimistic mutation) so the board reflects server truth.
- States: a brief loading indicator on first fetch; an "empty" message for an empty column /
  no tasks; an error banner (with the status/message) on failure that retries on the next
  tick.

## Actions

All actions go through the API; the board you see can be stale, so **every action handles a
409 gracefully** — surface the message, refetch, never crash.

- **Promote** (`p`, on a `backlog` task): `PromoteTask(id)` → refetch. 409 → "not in backlog
  (already moved?)".
- **Approve** (`a`, on a `review` task): optional note → **confirm** (because `done` is
  terminal in the state machine and cannot be undone) → `ReviewTask(id, actor, "approve",
  note)` then `TransitionTask(id, "done", note)`.
- **Reject** (`x`, on a `review` task): a small text input for the **required reason** →
  `ReviewTask(id, actor, "reject", reason)` then `TransitionTask(id, "ready", reason)`. The
  reason lands in the event log, and the task returns to the claimable pool for rework.
- `actor` on review events comes from config (`actor`, default `$USER`).

## Detail view

`enter` opens a **full-screen** detail (not a cramped split); `esc` returns to the board.
Shows: title, state, the full `spec` (scrollable viewport), `depends_on` resolved to task
titles, `links` (with `o` to open the `pr` link in `$BROWSER`/`open`/`xdg-open`), `result`,
`assignee`, lease countdown, and created/updated timestamps. On `review` tasks the same
`a`/`x` actions are available from the detail view.

From detail you can also open the task's **source documents** in the browser:

- `s` — the task's **own source doc** (its `document_id`: the design/feature_spec it was
  decomposed from).
- `d` — the project's **base design** doc (`kind=design`).

Both resolve a `Document.ref` to a VCS browse URL the same way `o` resolves a PR link: the
TUI fetches `GET /projects/{id}/documents` (to map `document_id → ref` and find the design
doc), then builds `project.repo` + `/blob/` + (`Document.commit` if pinned, else the default
branch) + `/ref` and opens it. If a `ref` is already a URL, open it directly; if there's no
repo, no design doc, or the ref can't be resolved, show a brief message. Agentask stores only
the ref — the TUI builds the URL (GitHub-shaped; abstract for other forges later).

## Keybindings (full)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←/→`, `h/l` | switch column |
| `↑/↓`, `j/k` | move selection |
| `enter` | open detail |
| `esc` | back / close |
| `p` | promote (backlog → ready) |
| `a` | approve (review → done, confirmed) |
| `x` | reject (review → ready, reason required) |
| `o` | open the task's PR link in the browser |
| `s` | (detail) open the task's source doc in the browser |
| `d` | (detail) open the project's base design doc in the browser |
| `r` | refresh now |
| `?` | toggle help overlay |
| `q`, `ctrl+c` | quit |

## Visual design

- State-tinted columns/badges (e.g. backlog dim, ready blue, in_progress yellow, review
  magenta, done green), counts in the tab headers, a persistent status/help bar.
- Lease rendered as a live countdown (`2m11s`) and `EXPIRED` (red) when past — an expired
  lease on an `in_progress` task means it's reclaimable.
- Styling via `lipgloss`; degrade gracefully on narrow/low-color terminals.

## Testing

- The API client is an interface; model tests use a **mock client** with canned data.
- Bubble Tea model tests via `teatest` (charmbracelet): drive key messages, assert on the
  rendered output (golden files) — column switching, selection stability across a simulated
  refresh, the promote/approve/reject flows (including the confirm and the reject-reason
  input), and error rendering.
- The HTTP client gets a thin test against an `httptest` server for request shape + parsing.

## Task breakdown

Tightly coupled UI (one Bubble Tea model), so a **linear chain** — one claimable at a time
(`depends_on` enforces it):

1. **TUI-1 — scaffold, config, client, project picker.** `cmd/agentask-tui`; config
   resolution (file + env + flags, precedence, `$USER` default for actor, token warning);
   the `tuiclient` interface + HTTP impl (`ListProjects/ListTasks/GetTask/ListDocuments/
   PromoteTask/ReviewTask/TransitionTask`) + a mock; a Bubble Tea app that connects, shows a project
   picker (auto-select on one/default), and quits on `q`; `tui` Makefile target.
   **Acceptance:** builds; `make tui` produces `bin/agentask-tui`; with valid config it lists
   projects (or auto-selects); bad config errors cleanly; client httptest + a model test pass.
   *(no deps)*
2. **TUI-2 — board view, nav, polling.** Focused-column/tabs layout; bucket `ListTasks` by
   state; cards with title and (in_progress) assignee + lease countdown; arrow/hjkl nav;
   poll + manual refresh with **ID-keyed selection stability**; loading/empty/error states.
   **Acceptance:** renders all five columns with counts; nav works; a simulated refresh keeps
   the selection; teatest goldens for layout + selection-stability + error. *(deps: TUI-1)*
3. **TUI-3 — promote.** `p` on a `backlog` task → `PromoteTask` → refetch; 409 surfaced.
   **Acceptance:** promoting a backlog task moves it to ready and the board updates; a 409 is
   shown, not fatal; model test covers both. *(deps: TUI-2)*
4. **TUI-4 — review actions.** `a` approve (optional note + confirm) → review-approve +
   transition-done; `x` reject (required reason) → review-reject + transition-ready; `actor`
   from config. **Acceptance:** approve moves a review task to done (with confirm); reject
   requires a reason and returns it to ready; both record the verdict; model tests cover the
   confirm and the reason input. *(deps: TUI-3)*
5. **TUI-5 — detail view + doc/PR opening.** Full-screen detail (`enter`/`esc`); scrollable
   spec; deps resolved to titles; review actions available from detail. Open links in the
   browser: `o` (PR), `s` (the task's source doc), `d` (the project's base design) — each
   resolving a stored ref (`pr` link, or `Document.ref` via `ListDocuments` + `project.repo`
   + optional `commit` pin) to a VCS URL; brief message when a ref can't be resolved.
   **Acceptance:** detail shows spec/deps/links/result/meta; `o`/`s`/`d` build the correct
   URLs and invoke the opener (asserted via an injected opener fn in tests); unresolvable
   refs show a message, not a crash; `esc` returns. *(deps: TUI-4)*

## Feature-level acceptance

- `agentask-tui` builds, connects to a live Agentask via the resolved config, shows the board
  for a chosen project, promotes a backlog task, and approves/rejects a review task — all
  verified against the deployed instance.
- Uses only the public HTTP API (no DB access, no `internal/store` import).

## Future (post-v1)

- **Inline PR diffs in the review/detail pane** — the TUI fetches the diff from the VCS host
  using the stored `pr` link (`gh pr diff`, or the GitHub diff API), rendered in a scrollable,
  syntax-colored viewport. **Agentask never stores the diff** — the `TaskLink(pr|commit)` is
  the ref, the client resolves it (consistent with "stores refs, not content"). Zero backend
  change; VCS-coupled (abstract the diff source if going multi-forge).
- **Event timeline** per task — requires a new `GET /tasks/{id}/events` endpoint (the event
  spine isn't API-exposed yet). The one item that needs backend work first.
- **Live** updates via an SSE/stream endpoint instead of polling.
- **Multi-project** aggregate view.
- Create/edit tasks from the TUI (shell out to `$EDITOR` for the spec).
- Block/fail a task from the TUI (the `transition` endpoint already supports it).
